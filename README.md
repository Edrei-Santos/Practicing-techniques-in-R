# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Rstudio

Here I'll put all exercises and notes related to PCA in Rstudio.

I'm currently learning the subject in my "Multivariate Analysis" course at my university.

The book I'm learning from is "Análise de Dados Através de Métodos de Estatística Multivariada: Uma Abordagem Aplicada" by Sueli Aparecida Mingoti, teacher from Federal University of Minas Gerais.
