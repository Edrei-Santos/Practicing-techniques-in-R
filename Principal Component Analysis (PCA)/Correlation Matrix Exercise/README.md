# PCA use example using a correlation matrix

The downside of using covariance matrix is that variables with larger variances will dominate the components. This is not a problem when the variables are measured in the same units and scales, but it can become one if they are not.

To fix this problem we are going to make the analysis with a covariance matrix.
